# 🙌 Hi everyone! I'm Benjamin Arias

🎓 I’m a **Mechanical Engineering student** in UNR (Rosario National University) from Rosario, Argentina. I am passionate about **material science**, **automation** and **computational mechanics**. 
I enjoy developing and leading projects and researches to discover new things that can help not only in industrial, but also in educational environments.

## 🚀 Projects i have worked on
- 🔬 **Tribological study** of the effect of shot peening on the wear resistance of a superferritic steel. (Poster presentation in International Congress SAM-CONAMET 2024)
- ⚙️ **Development of computational tools** for solving problems with strength criteria and visualizing the Cauchy stress tensor. (*LAMBDA* programm, developed in MatLab GUIDE)
- 🧭 **Numerical simulations of drone rototranslation motion using geometric algebra**, implemented in *Julia* with quaternion-based formulations.
